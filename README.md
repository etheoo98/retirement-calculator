# retirement-calculator
C# console application made for a beginners programming course.

## Assignment description
### This assignment is (at least) about:
* Two variable types
* Mathematical calculations
* Output management

In this assignment, you must ask the user for their first and last name, as well as their age. These values should be stored in appropriate variables.

Afterwards it should be outputted how many years are left until they retire, together with the user's first and last name. This means that if the user enters the age of 25, it should say that they have 40 years left until retirement (65-25).

Keep in mind how the output look - the program should look nice and simple. The output at the end could look like this, for example: Hello _Martin Persson_! There are now _22_ years left until you retire.
